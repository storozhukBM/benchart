# benchart

benchart - is a tool that takes [benchstat -csv](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat#section-readme)
output as an input and plots results of your benchmark in a html file.
All you need to do is format your benchmark's name properly.

All measurement attributes that benchart parses should be split by `;` and every attribute consists of key and value
separated by `:`. Every measurement should have at least 2 attributes: one it `type` that will be used to label your
chart and one additional attribute that will act as `x-axis` by default the last attribute will be interpreted
as  `x-axis`.

```
name,time/op (ns/op),Â±
Hash/type:crc32;bytes:8-8,4.47967E+00,0%
     |________| |_____|
      mandatory  x-axis
      attribute
```

You can also provide additional chart option sets. Every chart option set should have chart name at the beginning and then set
of options separated by `;`. Every option in a set should have key and value separated by `=`.
Supported options:
 - `title` - string start will be used as a graph title instead of name from csv file
 - `xAxisName` - overrides x-axis name on graph
 - `xAxisType` - changes type of x-axis, by default we use linear scale, but you can specify `log` scale 
 - `yAxisType` - changes type of y-axis, by default we use linear scale, but you can specify `log` scale 

Example of a command with options specified 

> benchart 'Hash;title=Benchmark of hash functions;xAxisName=bytes size;xAxisType=log' input.csv result.html
